### What I learned

While working on this project, I reinforced my understanding of the following concepts:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the page layout adjusts seamlessly between different screen sizes using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Effectively using both layout models to create complex layouts.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Utilizing CSS variables for theming and easier maintainability.

Here's a code snippet of an approach I'm particularly proud of:

```css
.container header .first .asideFirst button {
  font-size: 17px;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 1em 2.5em;
  border-radius: 6em;
  background-color: hsl(322, 100%, 66%);
  color: white;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.container header .first .asideFirst button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-3px);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

    Advanced CSS Animations: I plan to explore more advanced CSS animations and transitions to enhance user interaction.
    JavaScript Interactivity: Incorporating more JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
